## What is Laravel List?

Laravel List is a lightweight Laravel package that provides `ListCollection`, a specialized collection class that enforces sequential 0-based integer keys (0, 1, 2, 3...) at all times. It extends Laravel's powerful `Collection` class while guaranteeing true list behavior.

## The Problem It Solves

Laravel's standard `Collection` class is incredibly versatile, but this flexibility can lead to unexpected behavior when you need predictable, sequential keys:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Collection;

$collection = collect([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
$filtered = $collection->filter(fn($v) => $v > 2);

// Unexpected: Keys are preserved from original collection
$filtered->all(); // [2 => 3, 3 => 4, 4 => 5]

// Problems arise:
$filtered[0]; // null (key 0 doesn't exist!)
$filtered->toJson(); // {"2":3,"3":4,"4":5} (JSON object, not array)
```

With `ListCollection`, keys are automatically reindexed after every operation:

```php
use dhy\LaravelList\ListCollection;

$list = new ListCollection([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
$filtered = $list->filter(fn($v) => $v > 2);

// Keys are always sequential
$filtered->all(); // [0 => 3, 1 => 4, 2 => 5]
$filtered[0]; // 3 (predictable access)
$filtered->toJson(); // [3,4,5] (JSON array)
```

## When to Use Laravel List

<Tip>
**Use `ListCollection` when you need:**
- Predictable sequential array keys
- JSON arrays (not objects) for API responses
- List-like behavior similar to Python lists or JavaScript arrays
- Protection against accidental associative key operations
</Tip>

<Note>
**Stick with standard `Collection` when you need:**
- Associative arrays with custom keys
- Key preservation across operations
- Methods like `groupBy()`, `keyBy()`, or `flip()`
</Note>

## Real-World Example

Imagine building an API endpoint that returns a filtered list of active users:

```php
use dhy\LaravelList\ListCollection;

public function getActiveUsers()
{
    $users = User::all(); // Eloquent Collection
    
    // Convert to ListCollection for guaranteed list behavior
    $activeUsers = new ListCollection($users)
        ->filter(fn($user) => $user->active)
        ->map(fn($user) => [
            'id' => $user->id,
            'name' => $user->name,
            'email' => $user->email,
        ])
        ->sortBy('name');
    
    // Always returns JSON array with sequential keys
    return response()->json($activeUsers);
    // Output: [{"id":1,"name":"Alice",...},{"id":3,"name":"Bob",...}]
}
```

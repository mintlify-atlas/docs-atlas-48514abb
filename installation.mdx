## Requirements

Before installing Laravel List, ensure your environment meets these requirements:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="PHP Version" icon="php">
    **PHP 8.3 or higher** is required for type hints and modern language features.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Laravel Version" icon="laravel">
    **Laravel 11.x or 12.x** is supported. Works with both versions seamlessly.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Installation via Composer

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the package">
    Run the following command in your Laravel project root:
    
    ```bash
    composer require derheyne/laravel-list
    ```
    
    This will install the package and its dependencies.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify installation">
    Check that the package is installed correctly:
    
    ```bash
    composer show derheyne/laravel-list
    ```
    
    You should see the package details and version information.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Start using ListCollection">
    Import and use the `ListCollection` class in your code:
    
    ```php
    use dhy\LaravelList\ListCollection;
    
    $list = new ListCollection([1, 2, 3]);
    ```
    
    No additional configuration is needed!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## That's It!

Unlike many Laravel packages, Laravel List requires **no configuration**, **no migrations**, and **no service provider registration**. It works out of the box.

<Note>
Laravel List is a simple, focused package that provides a single class: `ListCollection`. There are no config files to publish, no migrations to run, and no views to customize.
</Note>

## What Gets Installed

When you install Laravel List, you get:

- **ListCollection class**: The main collection wrapper in the `dhy\LaravelList` namespace
- **Full type support**: Complete PHPStan type annotations for IDE autocompletion
- **Laravel integration**: Seamless integration with Laravel's collection ecosystem

## Dependencies

Laravel List has minimal dependencies:

```json
{
  "php": "^8.3",
  "illuminate/contracts": "^11.0||^12.0",
  "illuminate/collections": "^11.0||^12.0"
}
```

These are typically already installed in your Laravel application.

## Upgrading

To upgrade to the latest version of Laravel List:

```bash
composer update derheyne/laravel-list
```

<Tip>
Check the [changelog](https://github.com/dhy/laravel-list/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for information about new features and breaking changes between versions.

## Compatibility Matrix

| Laravel List | PHP Version | Laravel Version |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| 1.x         | 8.3+        | 11.x, 12.x       |

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="PHP version too low">
    If you see an error about PHP version requirements:
    
    ```
    Your PHP version (8.2.x) does not satisfy that requirement.
    ```
    
    **Solution**: Upgrade to PHP 8.3 or higher. Laravel List uses modern PHP features like typed properties and union types that require PHP 8.3+.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Laravel version incompatible">
    If you see dependency conflicts with Laravel:
    
    ```
    Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.
    ```
    
    **Solution**: Ensure you're using Laravel 11.x or 12.x. Earlier versions are not supported.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Composer memory limit">
    If Composer runs out of memory during installation:
    
    ```
    PHP Fatal error: Allowed memory size exhausted
    ```
    
    **Solution**: Increase PHP's memory limit temporarily:
    
    ```bash
    php -d memory_limit=-1 $(which composer) require derheyne/laravel-list
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

description: Learn how to create a ListCollection instance with automatic reindexing
---

## Overview

The `ListCollection` constructor creates a new list collection from an array, iterable, or Arrayable object. It automatically reindexes all keys to sequential integers starting from 0, ensuring the list structure is maintained.

## Signature

```php
public function __construct($items = [])
```

<ParamField path="items" type="\Illuminate\Contracts\Support\Arrayable<array-key, TValue>|iterable<array-key, TValue>|null" default="[]">
  The items to include in the collection. Can be an array, Collection, or any iterable object.
</ParamField>

## Behavior

The constructor performs two key operations:

1. **Calls parent constructor**: Initializes the Collection with the provided items
2. **Reindexes keys**: Converts all keys to sequential integers (0, 1, 2, ...) using `array_values()`

This ensures that regardless of the input array's keys, the resulting collection always maintains list structure with sequential integer keys.

## Examples

### Creating from associative array

Associative keys are discarded and replaced with sequential integers:

```php
$list = new ListCollection(['a' => 1, 'b' => 2, 'c' => 3]);

$list->all();
// [0 => 1, 1 => 2, 2 => 3]
```

### Creating from non-sequential keys

Non-sequential integer keys are reindexed:

```php
$list = new ListCollection([5 => 'a', 10 => 'b', 15 => 'c']);

$list->all();
// [0 => 'a', 1 => 'b', 2 => 'c']
```

### Creating from empty input

```php
$list = new ListCollection();

$list->all();
// []

$list->count();
// 0
```

### Creating from a Collection

You can create a ListCollection from an existing Laravel Collection:

```php
$collection = new Collection(['x' => 1, 'y' => 2, 'z' => 3]);
$list = new ListCollection($collection);

$list->all();
// [0 => 1, 1 => 2, 2 => 3]
```

### Creating with single item

```php
$list = new ListCollection(['only']);

$list->all();
// [0 => 'only']
```

## Key Points

- All keys are automatically converted to sequential integers (0, 1, 2, ...)
- Original keys are discarded, preserving only values and their order
- Works with arrays, Collections, and any iterable objects
- Empty collections are valid and contain no elements
